To write to an object in AMMS (Advanced Memory Management System), you need to perform a mutable borrow to gain exclusive access to the object's data. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

### Writing to an Object

1. **Create the Object**: Start by creating an object using `create_object`.

2. **Perform a Mutable Borrow**: Use `borrow_mutable` to borrow the object mutably. This gives you the ability to modify its contents.

3. **Write Data**: Use the pointer returned by `borrow_mutable` to write data to the object.

4. **Release the Borrow**: After finishing the modifications, call `return_object` to release the mutable borrow.

5. **Destroy the Object**: When you’re done with the object, make sure to free its memory with `destroy_object`.

### Example Code

Here's an example demonstrating how to write to an object using AMMS:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

// Assume necessary AMMS function declarations here
// e.g., create_object, borrow_mutable, return_object, destroy_object

int main() {
    // Step 1: Create the object
    ManagedObject* my_object = create_object(256);

    // Step 2: Perform a mutable borrow
    char* modify_data = (char*)borrow_mutable(my_object);
    if (modify_data) {
        // Step 3: Write data to the object
        strcpy(modify_data, "Writing to the AMMS object!");
        
        // You can also write other types of data if needed
        // Example: modify_data[0] = 'A';  // Writing a single character
    }

    // Step 4: Release the mutable borrow
    return_object(my_object);

    // To verify the written data, perform an immutable borrow
    char* read_data = (char*)borrow_immutable(my_object);
    if (read_data) {
        printf("Object data: %s\n", read_data);  // Should print the written data
    }
    return_object(my_object);

    // Step 5: Destroy the object to free memory
    destroy_object(my_object);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Creating the Object**: `ManagedObject* my_object = create_object(256);` initializes an object capable of holding 256 bytes.
  
- **Mutable Borrow**: The `borrow_mutable(my_object)` function allows writing to the object's data. The returned pointer is then used to modify the content.

- **Writing Data**: The `strcpy` function copies the string into the object's memory. You can also write other types of data directly using indexing.

- **Releasing the Borrow**: After writing, call `return_object(my_object)` to release the mutable borrow.

- **Verifying the Data**: An immutable borrow (`borrow_immutable(my_object)`) is performed to read and print the data, confirming that the write was successful.

- **Cleaning Up**: Finally, `destroy_object(my_object)` is called to deallocate the memory used by the object.

### Important Notes
- Ensure that no other mutable or immutable borrows are active when you perform a mutable borrow.
- Always release borrows before destroying the object to prevent memory leaks or dangling pointers.
